## About Noir

[Noir](https://noir-lang.org/) is a domain-specific language for writing zero-knowledge circuits. It provides a Rust-like syntax with features designed for ZK development, including native field arithmetic, constraint generation, and proving system integration.

This plugin brings first-class Noir support to JetBrains IDEs, leveraging the official `nargo lsp` language server for accurate, up-to-date IDE intelligence.
