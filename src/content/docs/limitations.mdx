import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page documents known limitations of the plugin. Understanding these helps set appropriate expectations.

## IDE Version Requirement

<Aside type="caution">
  The plugin requires **JetBrains IDE 2025.2** or later.
</Aside>

**Why:** The plugin uses JetBrains' native LSP API, which was introduced in version 2025.2. This API provides better performance and integration than older approaches.

**Affected users:** Anyone using IDE versions prior to 2025.2 (e.g., 2024.x, 2023.x).

**Workaround:** Update to IDE version 2025.2 or later. All JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, RustRover, WebStorm, etc.) version 2025.2+ are supported.

## Test Gutter Icon (Preview Feature)

**Current state:** The plugin shows a test tube icon next to `#[test]` functions in the gutter.

**Limitation:** Clicking the icon does not run the test. The run action is not yet implemented.

```noir
#[test]  // ← Test tube icon appears here
fn test_example() {
    assert(1 + 1 == 2);
}
```

**Current behavior:**
- Icon is displayed ✓
- Visual indicator of test functions ✓
- Run test on click ✗ (not implemented)

**Workaround:** Run tests from the terminal:
```bash
nargo test
# or specific test
nargo test test_example
```

## No Run Configuration

**Limitation:** The plugin does not provide run configurations for Noir programs. You cannot run or debug Noir programs directly from the IDE.

**Workaround:** Use the terminal:
```bash
# Execute the program
nargo execute

# Run tests
nargo test

# Build the circuit
nargo compile

# Generate proofs
nargo prove
```

<Aside type="tip">
  You can configure External Tools in the IDE to run nargo commands:
  Settings → Tools → External Tools → Add (+)
</Aside>

## No Nargo.toml Support

**Limitation:** The plugin does not parse or provide intelligence for `Nargo.toml` files.

**What doesn't work:**
- Syntax highlighting for Nargo.toml
- Completion for dependency names
- Validation of configuration values
- Navigation to dependency sources

**Workaround:** Edit Nargo.toml as a plain text file. Refer to the [Noir documentation](https://noir-lang.org/docs/reference/nargo_toml/) for the correct format.

## No Code Folding

**Limitation:** Functions, structs, modules, and other code blocks cannot be folded/collapsed.

```noir
fn example() {     // Cannot fold this
    // lots of code
}

struct Point {     // Cannot fold this either
    x: Field,
    y: Field,
}
```

**Workaround:** Use IDE navigation features instead:
- `Cmd+F12` / `Ctrl+F12` to see file structure
- `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` to jump to definitions

## No Structure View

**Limitation:** The Structure tool window (Alt+7) does not show an outline of Noir files.

**What doesn't work:**
- File outline in Structure panel
- Navigation via structure view
- Symbol overview

**Workaround:** Use:
- Search Everywhere (`Shift+Shift`) to find symbols
- Go to Symbol (`Cmd+Alt+O` / `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N`)
- Grep/search for function names

## nargo LSP Limitations

Some features depend on the capabilities of `nargo lsp`. Limitations in nargo's LSP affect the plugin.

**Examples:**
- Rename refactoring may not be available
- Some code actions may be missing
- Certain edge cases may not be handled

**Solution:** Update nargo to the latest version:
```bash
noirup
```

The Noir team continuously improves the LSP. Updating often enables new features.

## Performance on Large Projects

**Limitation:** Very large projects with many files may experience:
- Slow indexing on project open
- Delayed code completion
- High memory usage

**Workarounds:**
1. Enable lightweight mode (Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Noir)
2. Increase IDE memory (Help → Edit Custom VM Options → `-Xmx4096m`)
3. Exclude non-essential directories from indexing

## No Debugging Support

**Limitation:** The plugin does not provide debugging capabilities for Noir programs.

**Why:** Noir compiles to zero-knowledge circuits, which don't have a traditional debugging model with breakpoints and step-through execution.

**Alternatives:**
- Add `println` statements (in unconstrained functions)
- Use `assert` statements to check conditions
- Use `nargo test` for unit testing
- Use the Expand Macros action to inspect generated code

## Planned Improvements

These limitations are on the roadmap for future versions:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Run test from gutter | Planned |
| Nargo.toml support | Planned |
| Code folding | Planned |
| Structure view | Planned |
| Run configurations | Under consideration |
