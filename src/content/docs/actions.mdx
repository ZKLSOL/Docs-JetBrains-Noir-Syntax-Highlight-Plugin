The plugin adds several actions to the **Tools → Noir** menu for managing the language server and exploring Noir features.

## Restart Language Server

**Location:** Tools → Noir → Restart Language Server

Restarts the `nargo lsp` connection. Use this when:

- You've updated nargo to a new version
- The LSP seems stuck or unresponsive
- Code completion or diagnostics stop working
- You've changed nargo-related settings

<Steps>

1. Go to **Tools → Noir → Restart Language Server**
2. Wait for the LSP to reinitialize (status bar will show progress)
3. LSP features should now work with the fresh connection

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  If restarting doesn't help, try closing and reopening your `.nr` files, or restart the entire IDE.
</Aside>

## Expand Macros

**Location:** Tools → Noir → Expand Macros

Runs `nargo expand` on the current project and displays the expanded output.

This is useful for:
- Understanding what macros generate
- Debugging macro-related issues
- Seeing the full code after all macro expansions

### How It Works

<Steps>

1. Open a Noir project in your IDE
2. Go to **Tools → Noir → Expand Macros**
3. The plugin runs `nargo expand` in the background
4. Expanded output opens in a new scratch file

</Steps>

### Example

Given this code with a macro:

```noir
#[oracle(get_secret)]
unconstrained fn get_secret() -> Field {}

fn main() {
    let secret = unsafe { get_secret() };
}
```

The expand action shows the generated code after macro expansion, revealing the underlying implementation.

<Aside type="note">
  The expanded output is read-only and opened in a scratch file. Changes won't affect your actual source code.

## Browse Standard Library

**Location:** Tools → Noir → Browse Standard Library

Opens the Noir standard library source files in your IDE.

This is useful for:
- Understanding how stdlib functions work
- Finding available functions and modules
- Learning Noir idioms from official code

### How It Works

<Steps>

1. Go to **Tools → Noir → Browse Standard Library**
2. The plugin locates the stdlib in your nargo installation
3. The stdlib `lib.nr` file opens in the editor
4. Navigate through the stdlib modules from there

</Steps>

### Finding the Stdlib

The plugin finds the stdlib by:

1. Running `nargo --version` to find the nargo executable
2. Locating the stdlib relative to the nargo installation
3. Typically found at `~/.nargo/backends/acvm-backend-barretenberg/stdlib/`

<Aside type="caution">
  This action requires nargo to be installed. If nargo isn't found, you'll see an error message.
</Aside>

### Stdlib Structure

The standard library includes:

```
lib.nr              # Root module, re-exports everything
├── collections/    # Array utilities, vectors
├── convert/        # Type conversions
├── hash/           # Poseidon, Pedersen, SHA256, etc.
├── ec/             # Elliptic curve operations
├── field/          # Field arithmetic
├── merkle/         # Merkle tree utilities
├── schnorr/        # Schnorr signatures
├── ecdsa_secp256k1/ # ECDSA on secp256k1
└── ...
```

## Accessing Actions

Besides the menu, you can access actions via:

### Search Everywhere

Press **Shift+Shift** and type "Noir" to see all available actions:

- "Restart Noir Language Server"
- "Expand Macros"
- "Browse Standard Library"

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can assign custom keyboard shortcuts:

<Steps>

1. Go to **Settings → Keymap**
2. Search for "Noir"
3. Right-click an action → **Add Keyboard Shortcut**
4. Press your desired key combination
5. Click **OK**

</Steps>
