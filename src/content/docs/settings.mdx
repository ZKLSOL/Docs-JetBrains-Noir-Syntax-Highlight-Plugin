import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The plugin provides both application-level (global) and project-level settings.

**Location:** Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Noir

## Application Settings (Global)

These settings apply to all projects unless overridden at the project level.

### Available Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Nargo path** | Path to the `nargo` executable | Auto-detect from PATH |
| **Enable LSP** | Enable/disable the language server | Enabled |
| **Lightweight mode** | Disable completions, signature help, and code actions | Disabled |

### Nargo Path

By default, the plugin searches for `nargo` in your system PATH. You can override this with an explicit path:

```
/Users/yourname/.nargo/bin/nargo
```

This is useful when:
- nargo isn't in your PATH
- You have multiple nargo versions installed
- Your IDE doesn't inherit your shell's PATH

### Enable LSP

Toggle the language server on/off. When disabled:
- Syntax highlighting still works
- Code completion is disabled
- Diagnostics are disabled
- Go-to-definition is disabled
- Hover information is disabled

<Aside type="tip">
  Disabling LSP can be useful for viewing files without nargo installed, or when working on very large projects where LSP causes performance issues.
</Aside>

### Lightweight Mode

When enabled, the LSP runs in a reduced feature mode:

| Feature | Normal Mode | Lightweight Mode |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Syntax highlighting | Yes | Yes |
| Diagnostics | Yes | Yes |
| Go to definition | Yes | Yes |
| Hover information | Yes | Yes |
| **Code completion** | Yes | **No** |
| **Signature help** | Yes | **No** |
| **Code actions** | Yes | **No** |

Use lightweight mode when:
- Working with large projects
- Your machine has limited resources
- You only need basic navigation and error checking
- LSP responses are slow

## Project Settings (Override)

Project settings override application settings for a specific project.

### Accessing Project Settings

<Steps>

1. Open your project in the IDE
2. Go to **Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Noir**
3. The same settings panel shows both levels
4. Project-specific values override global values

</Steps>

### Nargo Path Override

You can set a different nargo path per-project. This is useful when:
- Different projects require different nargo versions
- You're testing with a development build of nargo
- Team members have different nargo installation paths

### Settings Precedence

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Project Settings            │ ← Highest priority
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│     Application Settings        │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│     Auto-detect (PATH)          │ ← Lowest priority
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

When determining which nargo to use:

1. **Project settings override** - If set, use this
2. **Application settings** - If set, use this
3. **PATH auto-detection** - Search PATH for `nargo`

## Applying Settings Changes

Most settings take effect immediately. However:

- **Nargo path changes**: Restart LSP to use the new path
  - Go to **Tools → Noir → Restart Language Server**

- **Enable LSP toggle**: May require reopening files
  - Close and reopen any `.nr` files

- **Lightweight mode**: Takes effect immediately
  - No restart needed

## Settings Storage

| Setting Level | Storage Location |
|---------------|------------------|
| Application | `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/[IDE]/options/NoirSettings.xml` (macOS) |
| Project | `.idea/workspace.xml` in your project |

<Aside type="caution">
  Project settings are stored in `.idea/workspace.xml`, which is typically gitignored. This means project settings aren't shared between team members by default.
</Aside>

## Resetting to Defaults

To reset settings:

<Steps>

1. Go to **Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Noir**
2. Clear the nargo path field (to use auto-detection)
3. Check "Enable LSP" to enable
4. Uncheck "Lightweight mode" to disable
5. Click **OK**

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Settings

### Settings Not Taking Effect

1. Restart the language server: **Tools → Noir → Restart Language Server**
2. Restart the IDE completely
3. Check the IDE logs for errors: **Help → Show Log in Finder/Explorer**

### Can't Find Settings Panel

The settings panel appears under **Languages & Frameworks → Noir**. If you don't see it:
1. Ensure the plugin is installed and enabled
2. Go to **Settings → Plugins** and verify "Noir" is listed and enabled
3. Restart the IDE
